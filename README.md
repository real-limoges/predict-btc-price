#Predict BTC Price Using Neural Networks

Overview
-----

Data Sources
--------

This is by far the trickiest part - not only picking the correct data sources but also making sure that they're widely available and would "move" the BTC market.


Implementation
------- 

Instead of a traditional G/ARCH or VAR model, I'm going to try a multivariate Recurrant Neural Network.
